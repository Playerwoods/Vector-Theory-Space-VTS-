**API**: [https://theory-engine-production.up.railway.app](https://theory-engine-production.up.railway.app)

## âœ¨ Features
- **Genuinely Generative**: Creates novel theoretical positions through mathematical exploration of high-dimensional embedding space
- **Testable Output**: Each theory includes 3-5 empirically testable conjectures
- **Quality Metrics**: Novelty, coherence, testability, and generativity scoring
- **Academic Focus**: Built specifically for social science research workflows

## ðŸ’° Pricing
- **$20 for 15 uses** ($1.33 per generation)
- Each use generates 5 complete theories with conjectures
- Saves 10-20 hours of traditional theoretical development per use

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works
Uses 10 fundamental theoretical dimensions to explore conceptual space:
- Authority & Power | Legitimacy & Consent | Institutional Design
- Collective Action | Justice & Rights | Resource Distribution
- Social Order | Political Participation | Conflict Resolution | Democratic Processes

## ðŸ“Š Example Output
**Input**: "democratic peace theory"
**Generated**: Novel theories exploring authority structures, institutional design, and conflict resolution mechanisms with specific testable conjectures

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
- Literature review acceleration
- Grant proposal development
- Dissertation theory chapters
- Conference presentation preparation
- Research agenda development
